# xmlite

![Release version](https://img.shields.io/badge/alpha-v0.0.1-red.svg)
![C++ version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-C++11-blue.svg)

A light-weight single-include C++ XML library, relying on KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple)
principle and C++11 STL (similar to my other json library [jsonlite](https://github.com/makuke1234/jsonlite)).


# Overview

Yes, this library is designed to aim for fast compilation times, simplicity and
ease of use and almost full compliancy with XML standard, nothing else.


# Features

* DOM support by default
* BOM support:
	* UTF-1
	* UTF-7
	* UTF-8
	* UTF-16 (little endian & big endian)
	* UTF-32 (little endian & big endian)
* BOM to DOM conversion


# C bindings

Yet again bindings for C are planned like with my other jsonlite library.


# Licensing

This project is uses the MIT license.
